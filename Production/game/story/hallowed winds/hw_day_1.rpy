As you all know, Hallowed Winds is a fast-paced 2D action platformer with lots of characters and RPG elements. It may be a medieval fantasy, but we're all real here! So please, before you start posting, read these rules!\n Rule 1: Be Nice! There's no need to be mean, and throwing abuse or harassing other people will only get you permabanned. Don't be that guy.\n Rule 2: Let Threads Stay Dead! If it's been a day since the original post, let the thread die! The introductory thread is the only exception to this. Three strikes doing this and you're out!\n Rule 3: Obey the Law! No posting anything illegal here! If you link to illegal content in the forum, you'll be sent to the Ban Bin!\n Rule 4: Have Fun! We're all here because we love Hallowed Winds, and we wouldn't be here if the games weren't fun. So stick with the spirit of the game and Have Fun!\n That's all for now!
